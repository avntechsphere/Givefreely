♻️ Give It For Free

Give It For Free is a community-driven platform that helps people give away usable items for free instead of throwing them away.
The goal is to reduce waste, encourage reuse, and build a local sharing community.

This project is non-profit, open-source, and built with scalability in mind.

🌍 Why this project?

Many people have items they no longer need, while others may need them but cannot afford to buy them.
This platform connects both sides — no money involved, only sharing.
